### Answer button properties

You can add **up to four buttons at maximum**, each of which should have the following properties defined (please refer to the default config for the exact syntax and formatting):

- `Description` [text]: appears above the button
- `Label` [text]: the label of the button
- `ShortCut` [text]: the shortcut key for the button
- `ReschedMin` [number]: same as the lower number in the Browser's "Edit/Rescedule" command
- `ReschedMax` [number]: same as the higher number in the Browser's "Edit/Rescedule" command
