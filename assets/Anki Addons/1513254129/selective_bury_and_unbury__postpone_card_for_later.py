    Anki has only a function to unbury all buried cards. This should be a quick
    and verifiable add-on. Dealing with the database directly would be more
    complicated. Workaround: get a list of all buried cards, unbury all, rebury
    those that are not in my list later_ids. This has been tested with about 50
    buried cards and I didn't notice any delays. This add-on is not tested in
    extreme situations like thousands of buried cards (that you might have if
    you use sibling burying and add 100 notes of a note type that has 50
    cards...)
